# 人脸口罩分类数据集（Face-Mask-Classification-Dataset，FMCD）

CPVID-19具有极强的传染性，通过飞沫和密切接触传播是主要传播途径。多个国家强调在口罩充足的前提下，需佩戴医用外科口罩或N95口罩做好个人防护，佩戴合格口罩可以有效抵制病毒危害。相比于普通棉质口罩，医用口罩与N95口罩的防护效果更好。本文公开口罩分类数据集便于研究。

## 数据集下载
本文的face mask classification dataset将RMFD数据集和MAFA数据集中佩戴口罩的人脸进行裁剪并筛选，大小归一化为224x224，将口罩类别分为合格口罩（OK-mask，主要为N95口罩与一次性医用口罩）包含1361张，和不合格口罩（NG-mask，主要包括海绵口罩、布口罩和围巾等）包含1880张，共包含3241张图像用于口罩分类，如图所示。

# Face-Mask-Classification-Dataset（FMCD）

CPVID - 19 with a strong infectivity, spread by droplets and close contact is the main route of transmission. Many countries emphasize the need to wear surgical masks or N95 masks for personal protection as long as masks are sufficient. Wearing qualified masks can effectively protect against virus hazards. Compared with cloth masks, surgical masks and N95 masks have better protective effect. In this paper, the mask classification data set is disclosed for the convenience of research.

## Download Dataset

In this paper, the face mask classification dataset will RMFD data sets and MAFA data set by cutting face and screening of wearing masks, the size to one becomes 224 x224, masks categories can be divided into qualified masks (OK-mask, mainly for N95 masks and disposable surgical masks) contains 1361, and unqualified masks (NG-mask, mainly including the sponge masks, cloth masks and scarves, etc.) contains 1880, contains 3241 images are used to mask classification.
